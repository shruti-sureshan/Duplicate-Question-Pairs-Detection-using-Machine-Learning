Future scope:
As a continuation to our project, in the future, a similar approach can be implemented for various other search engines that are
available like reedit, stack overflow, etc. This will ensure that search engines are user-friendly. Furthermore, the best models of
each type (linear, tree-based, and neural network) can be grouped. Additionally, more features for the tree-based models can
also be designed.
