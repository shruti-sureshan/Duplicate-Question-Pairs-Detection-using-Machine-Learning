# Duplicate-Question-Pairs-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Quora is a growing platform comprising of a user-generated collection of questions and answers. Identifying semantically similar questions on Quora is challenging as natural language is very expressive. In this project, our approach primarily focuses on Machine learning techniques for detecting whether a pair of questions asked on Quora is duplicate or not. Our emphasis is to address the drawbacks, as mentioned earlier, by taking the text input and preprocessing it, followed by feature extraction using Bag of Words and TF-IDF algorithm. Further, the questions are classified as duplicate and non-duplicate by applying machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine. The proposed algorithms have been experimented using the Quora Question Pair dataset released by Quora. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated and compared using different parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The proposed application of SVM with Bag of Words Technique in duplicate question pair detection has proved better in terms of all parameters as compared to the other existing algorithms.
